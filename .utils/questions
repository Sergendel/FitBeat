1. My current agent explicitly provides flexible and detailed planning for various scenarios.
   However, I've noticed some situations where an "Execution Capability Gap" arises.
   How important is it to explicitly handle or mitigate this scenario within the scope of this assessment?

2. My agent explicitly uses RAG to refine and rank the final output.
   Is it necessary for this assessment to explicitly prove the effectiveness provided by RAG,
   or is it sufficient to illustrate that RAG integration is implemented and functional?

3.I'm currently working on integrating memory into my agent.
  Would a simple file-based storage solution (e.g., JSON) be sufficient for demonstrating this capability in the assessment,
  or am I expected to use more robust solutions like PostgreSQL or cloud-based storage?

4. Which parts of the agent logic should be explicitly prioritized in testing?
   Would including end-to-end tests add significant value ?
   Should I invest in testing  variability in LLM responses issues?
