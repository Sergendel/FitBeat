18 ContributorsGol D Roger Lyrics[Chorus]
I feel like Roger, way I been gold
Act like a God, they chase what I hold
King of the Pirates, they look to my guidance
So now they go ride for lands I foretold
I feel like Roger, way I been gold
Act like a God, they chase what I hold
King of the Pirates, they look to my guidance
So now they go ride for lands I foretold
I'm leaving behind my treasure and gold

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I feel like I'm Roger
They gon' ride for my coffers
They want me to be mad, they want what I have
I want them to prosper
Yеah we deal in gold with no coppers
Choppеr flow, they broke with no doctors
Cop the throne and shown them my roster
Pirate King, they want what I offer
Box 'em out, leave a man like Gaimon
Jozu flow how these hands like diamonds
Talk with Kings like Poseidon
Got the power scalers whining 'bout bad writing
Sit down
Acting like Wapol they got big mouths
They ain't even messing with the Kings crown
Newgate to Weevils
They be my sons, but they act like they discount
I got my ships out
Act like they Gin, how they change when they see how we eating
Watch how I'm leading
I stay ahead of the show, how I'm reading
Kuzan, so cold
I'm gon' leave a boy freezing
Malnutrition, how your berries low
Down so bad you need a periscope
I keep a long arm like it's Jerry's coach
Watch this GOAT rise
How the Merry floats
I got the Judge on me I don't need a jury
Watch 'em big brother
Like I'm Katakuri
I go Franky on 'em
Now they cyberbullied
Be like Iva, how I'm turning pricks to pussies
They be wanting pleasure
Like my name was Stussy
Dropping kilos on 'em like its Valentine
You gon' see the worst like I'm a Super Rookie
I be leaving oceans like a paradise


[Chorus]
I feel like Roger, way I been gold
Act like a God, they chase what I hold
King of the Pirates, they look to my guidance
So now they go ride for lands I foretold
I feel like Roger, way I been gold
Act like a God, they chase what I hold
King of the Pirates, they look to my guidance
So now they go ride for lands I foretold
I'm leaving behind my treasure and gold

[Verse 2]
Conquerors Haki, I'm taming the crowd
Apoo I'll make 'em drop when I'm loud
Done with these pirates, they act like they Eneru
They think their Gods but their heads in the clouds
Burned to the ground
They be watching like ChouChou
I got the clout to make Goresei bow down
Fucked around and they found out
Feat flames, I hit 'em like Sanji Roundhouse
Pen my scripts in poneglyphs and redstone
Hajrudin, I do it big, I'm well known
Man's like Im
They wanna win but they won't
Afro King, I'm in the ring K.O
Knockout
Mans like Garp when the Rocks out
Put in their place like it's lockdown
Dropping these OPs and I've lost count
Scratch off the numbers
Mans got a bingo card that I've crossed out
Read it back
X-ing them out like a treasure map
I'm spitting knowledge like Tekking Rants
They battle with less protection than even Rebecca has
I got a pen and it gives life
Devil's Luck Pirates, they know I'm gon' bid high
I got my crew at my back in a fist fight
They call me Roger, my death is what people will live by


[Bridge]
I feel like Roger, way I been gold
Act like a God, they chase what I hold
King of the Pirates, they look to my guidance
So now they go ride for lands I foretold
I feel like Roger, way I been gold
Act like a God, they chase what I hold
King of the Pirates, they look to my guidance
So now they go ride for lands I foretold
I'm leaving behind my treasure and gold

[Chorus]
I feel like Roger, way I been gold
Act like a God, they chase what I hold
King of the Pirates, they look to my guidance
So now they go ride for lands I foretold
I feel like Roger, way I been gold
Act like a God, they chase what I hold
King of the Pirates, they look to my guidance
So now they go ride for lands I foretold
I'm leaving behind my treasure and gold
I feel like Roger, way I been gold
Act like a God, they chase what I hold
King of the Pirates, they look to my guidance
So now they go ride for lands I foretold
I feel like Roger, way I been gold
They not forgot the fame that I hold
King of the Pirates, they look to my guidance
So now they go ride for lands I foretold
I'm leaving behind my treasure and gold
