Have you ever seen a penguin dancing here?
When you look at me, a penguin you will see
Penguins, attention! Penguins, begin!
Right flipper!

When you look at me, a penguin you will see
Penguins, attention! Penguins, begin!
Right flipper! Left flipper!
Have you ever seen a penguin dancing here?
When you look at me, a pеnguin you will see
Penguins, attention! Penguins, bеgin!
Right flipper! Left flipper! Right foot!
Have you ever seen a penguin dancing here?
When you look at me, a penguin you will see
