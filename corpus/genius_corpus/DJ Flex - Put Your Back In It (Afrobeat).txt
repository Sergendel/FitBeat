Put your back in it
Put your back in it
Put your back in it
Just a little more
Put your back in it (Cobba, Cobba, Cobba)
Put your back in it (Cobba, Cobba, Cobba)
Put your back in it (Cobba, Cobba, Cobba)

[Verse 2]
What you waiting for (Cobba, Cobba, Cobba)
Put your back in it
Just a little more (Cobba, Cobba, Cobba)
Work! Throw your waist in it now
Work! Till your body's hurting (Cobba, Cobba, Cobba)
Work! Work it hard and long
Work! When you finish that (Cobba, Cobba, Cobba)
You better do it right

[Verse 3]
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Come up, come up
Come up, come up
Go-go-go down, go down
Go down, go down
Come up, come up
Come up, you better do it right


[Verse 4]
Put your back in -, back in -
Put your - *gun cocks*
Put your back in it, back in it, back in it
Put your back in it
Put your back, back, back, back
Put your back in it

[Verse 5]
Put your back in it
Put your back in it
Put your back in it
Throw your waist in it now
Put your back in it
Put your back in it
Put your back in it
I waan you go down, go down

[Outro]
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Come up, come up
Come up, come up
Go down, go down
Go down, go down
Come up, come up
Come up, come up
