You will get reward in a your life
And fe everyday that you get up and you do something wrong

So clean up your heart like you should
If you wan live good ina the neighbourhood
Clean up your heart like you should
If you're strong ina your mind then you no that you could
Fight off the badness and all evil ways
Beca we all wan see better days
Change all your mind and change your thinking
Mek them no that you ready and willing
Beca you done with fussing and all the fighting
Done with the drugs and all murdering
Done with the knife and all the stabbing
I say we want live good - in this ya system! me king you hear me a sing..
