Title: Sage Mode (Jiraiya Rap)
Artist: Rustage
Album: None

Description:
Jiraiya (自来也) was one of Konohagakure’s Sannin. Famed as a hermit and pervert of stupendous ninja skill, Jiraiya travelled the world in search of knowledge that would help his friends, the various novels he wrote, and, posthumously, the world in its entirety – knowledge that would be passed on to his godson and final student, Naruto Uzumaki.

12 ContributorsSage Mode (Jiraiya Rap) LyricsI'm the Toad Messiah
Spit from my esophagus, oil, I bring the fire
Though I'm getting old I'll never tire
Got more ninjas to inspire
Everybody knows the name of Jiraiya (that's right)
If you don't know me, legend shinobi
Trained two Hokages, that ranks below me
Though it gets lonely being this OP
If ninja being thinking they'll beat me then show me


Danger when I'm coming in
Handling all my summonings
Leaving these ninjas wondering
Why they bothered to stumble in
It's obvious I'm gonna win
Can you feel all the rumbling
Of chakra I'm outputting?
Your defenses are now crumbling
I tell your defeat like I'm writing these words on a page
I'm in a rage
Master of Wisdom, 'cause this is my vision
So listen, it's why they all call me a Sage (why's that?)
Myoboku's where I meditate
Senjutsu I accumulate, becoming great
And learning new techniques I need to educate
The child of the prophecy, he's gotta be my student
And if I fail my mission he'll become the end of humans
I will be protecting all my students in a heartbeat
Seems to be my fate to be tangled with Uzumakis
Crash like a tsunami, I'm stroger than the Kages
Hah, I'd rather just perv of Tsunade



Teach 'em what they know
Now that I'm repping my Sage Mode, oh
You better take note
Jiraiya's the name 'cause I say so, oh
Like a tornado
I'm coming through with my Sage Mode, oh
You make a great foe
I'm spitting like like a volcano, oh
Teach 'em what they know (they know)
Now that I'm repping my Sage Mode (Sage Mode), oh
You better take note (take note)
Jiraiya's the name 'cause I say so (say so), oh
Like a tornado ('nado)
I'm coming through with my Sage Mode (Sage Mode), oh
You make a great foe (great foe)
I'm spitting like like a volcano ('cano), oh


I've made mistakes through my life
I like to think I did right
Passing my knowledge to future generations
I be making it through heartache and strife
Dubbed as a Sanin but what does that make me?
Through every failure I'm trying to break free
People through my life have been calling me crazy
Even my closet of friend had betrayed me
So it's my duty to perfect their blows;
Nagato, Minato to Naruto
They call me a hermit, but that's just to cope
It's 'cause I feel like no place to my home
Trapping the Akatsuki I'm going after their leader
Shocked to hear the news that I was actually his teacher
But I'm gonna beat ya 'cause there's no way that I'm weaker
Gathering the intel I'm startin' up the procedure



If I knew this'd be my last battle
I would have done more
I've forced the hand of those I care about
And now I'm done for
And though my bloods on the floor
This message will bring hope
So I'm sorry Naruto
Now this toad has croaked


Teach 'em what they know
Now that I'm repping my Sage Mode, oh
You better take note
Jiraiya's the name 'cause I say so, oh
Like a tornado
I'm coming through with my Sage Mode, oh
You make a great foe
I'm spitting like like a volcano, oh
