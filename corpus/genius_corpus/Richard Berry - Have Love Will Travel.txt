(Have love) Well, baby now
(Will travel) Said I, yeah, I
(Have love) Well, baby now
(Will travel) Said I, yeah, I
And I say
If you need a loving man, will travel

[Verse 1: Richard Berry]
Say, I will travel from Maine to Mexico
Trying to find that girl to love me so
No matter where I go, no matter where I be
I just can't find the girl to satisfy me

[Chorus]
(Have love) Well, baby now
(Will travel) Said I, yeah, I
(Have love) Well, baby now
(Will travel) Said I, yeah, I
And baby
If you need a loving man, will travel

[Verse 2]
Say, I'm traveling light, not heavy, babe
So look for me to come past your way
I got arms full of loving waiting just for you
I even got a suitcase full of kisses too


[Chorus]
(Have love) Well, baby now
(Will travel) Said I, yeah, I
(Have love) Well, baby now
(Will travel) Said I, yeah, I
And baby
If you need a loving man, will travel

[Verse 3]
I might come by boat, I might come by plane
Baby, I might even catch the train
But if I can't get there that way
Then look for me to walk any old day

[Chorus]
(Have love) Well, baby now
(Will travel) Said I, yeah, I
(Have love) Well, baby now
(Will travel) Said I, yeah, I
And baby
If you need a loving man, will travel
