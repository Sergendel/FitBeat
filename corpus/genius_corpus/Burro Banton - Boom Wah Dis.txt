[Verse 1]
Nuff a talk 'bout mi brown, Jah Jah know, say, mi black
Mi slim, mi tell 'em Burro Banton no fat
Mi deejay fi baldhead an' dreadlocks
An' carry mi weak spot down in mi diamond socks
Mi favorite color, dat are yellow an' black
An' when mi go at show, yes, mi sit dung in a box
Show weh we watch star by Silver Fox
We badder than di sting out of a galliwasp
You trouble raw wire, say, you bound fi get shot
You hang a man, you hang him high in a treetop
A sound get drop, a Burro Banton do dat
It must be di lyrics dat a Burro-him chat

[Bridge]
Man, mi slim an' mi no fat, man, mi culture, mi no slack
But I man as a deejay, know mi nah turn back
Say, tick-a-tick-a-tack weh make di people-dem rock
Di jack a from di pack a man a rule any flock
Go tell 'em Burro Banton are di cream of di crop
An' any time mi pass, yes, di road have fi block


[Chorus]
Boom, wa dis, wa dat, a Burro Banton a chat
Boom, wa dis, wa dat, shot no respect no nat
Boom, wa dis, wa dat, a Burro Banton a chat
Boom, wa dis, wa dat, shot no respect no nat

[Verse 2]
True, nuff a sniff di coke an' nuff a melt di rock
An' nuff of dem a gwan like dem are bobo dreadlocks
Selassie I God nuff a dem did a mock
An' nuff of dem a wolf, man, in a sheep frock
Weh still a sniff coke an' still a melt rock
An' still a follow freaks, but mi nah in a dat
We have fi hold dem, beat dem badly, cut off dem dreadlocks
An' race dem outta Zion with a barrage of shot
True, nuff of dem a sting, Burro Banton a shock
Mi come in like a mountain weh build out of rock
Mi come in like a nut a weh you just cyaan crack
Mi come in like a sixteen, mi nuh stop fire shot

[Chorus]
Boom, wa dis, wa dat, a Burro Banton a chat
Boom, wa dis, wa dat, shot no respect no nat
Boom, wa dis, wa dat, a Burro Banton a chat
Boom, wa dis, wa dat, shot no respect no nat


[Verse 3]
Mi lay dung in mi bed, man, around six o' clock
Mi hear round di lane weh mi hear some newsflash
Mi peep through mi window, bad boy get shot
Say, hole in a him chest, come out in a him back
It seem like dem want him fi go a Dovecot
Say, six foot flat in a crisp casket box
Mi tell you when di raid pose up on top
The rude boy nowadays walk with gun 'pon cock
Di coolest singer that a Gregory Isaacs
Mi favorite singer name Sugar Minott

[Chorus]
Boom, wa dis, wa dat, a Burro Banton a chat
Boom, wa dis, wa dat, shot no respect no nat
Boom, wa dis, wa dat, a Burro Banton a chat
Boom, wa dis, wa dat, shot no respect no nat

[Outro]
Nuff a talk 'bout mi brown, Jah Jah know, say, mi black
Mi slim, mi tell 'em Burro Banton no fat
Mi deejay fi baldhead an' dreadlocks
An' carry mi weak spot down in mi diamond socks
Mi favorite color, dat are yellow an' black
An' when mi go at show, yes, mi sit dung in a box
Show weh we watch star by Silver Fox
Mi badder than di sting out of a galliwasp
You trouble raw wire, say, you bound fi get shot
You hang a man, you hang him high in a treetop
A sound get drop, a Burro Banton do dat
