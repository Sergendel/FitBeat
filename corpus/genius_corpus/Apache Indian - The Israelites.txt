1 ContributorThe israelites LyricsCould those little drops of water meeting under your chin be teardrops
Could that pain in your heart be there because you love a new love
Well I know just how you feel
Could those little drops of water meeting under your chin be teardrops
Could that pain in your heart be there because you love a new love
Well I know just how you feel
I felt that way for so many years
Ever since that cloudy day you told me goodbye
And with her you walked away
Now baby you're welcome
Now baby you're welcome back
Now baby you're welcome back to me

Did she put you down cause the new love she found looks better
Did you find that a few nights of fun were all she was after
Well I know just how you feel
I felt that way for so many years
Ever since that cloudy day you told me goodbye
And with her you walked away
Now baby you're welcome
Now baby you're welcome back
Now baby you're welcome back to me

Baby you're welcome
Now baby you're welcome back
Now baby you're welcome back to me
