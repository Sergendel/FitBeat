Title: Daft Punk Is Playing at My House
Artist: LCD Soundsystem
Album: Album(id, artist, ...)

Description:
“I tried to get them to play a house party. I love house parties from when I was a punk rock kid and I had spent so long obsessing on what was missing from indie rock that was present in dance music that I forgot what was present in indie music that was missing from house music. I just had this idea that someone might have gone through the same epiphany with dance music that they had and then ended up saving up to have Daft Punk to play in their basement. I wanted to do a documentary where we would get a local band to play in a basement, then us and then Daft Punk but film it like a proper rock show with the crowd shots and everything. And being the nature of what house parties are, not that many people would even know who Daft Punk are, which would be extra funny. There would just be this basement, Daft Punk, some kids, a keg and a washing machine. It would be great.” – James Murphy in a 2005

Oh
Ow, Ow

[Verse 1]
Well, Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes kid, show you the ropes
I got a bus and a trailer at my house, my house
I'll show you the ropes kid, show you the ropes
I bought fifteen cases for my house, my house
All the furniture is in the garage
Well, Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

[Chorus]
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up

[Verse 2]
Well, Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
I waited 7 years and 15 days
There's every kid for miles at my house, my house
And the neighbors can't call the police
There's a fist fight brewin' at my house, my house
Because the jocks can't get in the door
When Daft Punk is playing at my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up


[Chorus]
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up

[Cowbell Solo]

[Verse 3]
Well, everybody's lined up in my house, my house
And Sarah's girlfriend is working the door
Got everybody's PA in my house, my house
All the robots descend from the bus
There's a freak out brewing in my house, my house
In the basement
'Cause Daft Punk is playing in my house, my house
You got to set them up kid, set them up

[Chorus]
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set 'em up, ooh ooh yeah
You got to set them up, set them up


[Outro]
And never, never let them go
No never, never, never let them go
Never, never, never let them go
Let 'em go
Never, never, never let them go
Oh never, never, never let them go
Never, never, never let them go
Let them go
Downtown
