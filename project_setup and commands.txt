Flow without RAG:
User Prompt → Numeric Parameter Generation (LLM) → Initial Numeric Filtering → YouTube Retrieval → MP3 Conversion → Summary

flow with RAG
User Prompt → Numeric Parameter Generation → Initial Numeric Filtering →
→ Semantic Retrieval from Genius Corpus →
→ LLM-Based Refinement of Recommendations → YouTube Retrieval → MP3 Conversion → Summary



✅ Explicitly Clarified Workflow (exactly stated):
You explicitly use RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) as part of your existing recommendation workflow explicitly:

1. Numeric Filtering explicitly (Initial Step):

    You explicitly generate numeric parameters explicitly from a user prompt (tempo, danceability, energy, etc.).

    You explicitly filter your large Kaggle dataset explicitly to an initial candidate track list.

2. RAG (Semantic Retrieval explicitly):

    For every track explicitly in this initial candidate list explicitly,
    you explicitly retrieve lyrics or description context explicitly from your Genius corpus.

    If a track explicitly does not have available semantic context,
    you explicitly mark it explicitly as "No additional context available explicitly."

3. Final Ranking explicitly (LLM Refinement explicitly):

    You explicitly provide the LLM explicitly with:

        The user's original prompt explicitly.

        The retrieved lyrics/description (or lack of) explicitly for each candidate track explicitly.

    You explicitly instruct the LLM explicitly to use this additional semantic context explicitly to rank all the initial candidate tracks explicitly from most suitable to least suitable explicitly according to the user's intent explicitly.

4. Ranked Final Playlist explicitly (Output explicitly):

    Your final output explicitly is the exact same set of candidate tracks explicitly,
    now explicitly ranked based on how well each track explicitly matches the user's request,
    enhanced explicitly by the added semantic information (lyrics/descriptions explicitly).

    You explicitly do NOT use RAG explicitly to create a new track list explicitly or to generate new numeric parameters
    explicitly—only explicitly to refine (rank) clearly the tracks you've already selected explicitly.
